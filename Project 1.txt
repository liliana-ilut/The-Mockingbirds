Title: Correlation of obesity and food options by city population

Project Description:
Exploring the correlation between number and type of restaurants and obesity rate in the top 
300 cities by population

1. Does the amount of restaurants in a city equal a higher obesity rate (for the top 300 cities
   by population)
   - List of 300 cities by population
   - Obesity rate per city (rank)
   - List of total number of restaurants in each city
   
2. Can the type of restaurant in a city be a predictor of a city's economic standing
   (Have a focus on cuisine, breakdown - Yelp API?)

3. Does a city with a higher economic standing have a lower obesity rate
   - Can use previous data sets to determine this/arrive at a conclusion

4. Is there a particular correlation between cuisine/type of restaurant and obesity
   - Can use previous data sets to determine this/arrive at a conclusion

5. Is there a correlation between economic status and cuisine 


Does the amount of restaurants in a given city equal a higher obesity rate and can restaurant 
type be a predictor of a cities economic standing?  
(Economic Standing = Do the citizens tend to be wealthier or 
worse off the national average)
